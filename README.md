# Try not to laught Game

## Description

This is a "try not to laugh" game demo that uses [smile-detection](https://github.com/SeeknnDestroy/smile-detection) and [JokeAPI](https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/) to display random jokes and detect whether the user is smiling or not. If so you lose a life.
The basic demo is single player game restricted to 5 lives and 10 jokes. There is no way to lose or win, you just lose a life when smiling. The lives can be reset back to 5. The Jokes keep refreshing after a round of 10. Background image is generated randomly from [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/). Neither settings nor save function are currently working.
